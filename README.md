# R3D  
3D-ResNet used for lip-reading

***

This repo aims at implement the Residual Network first proposed in the paper [《Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition》](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) by Kaiming He et al. However, we modify it to the new version of 3D ResNet, named R3D, in order to fit it to the field of lip-reading.
